# wfc_python
An implementation of [mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) in Python

WaveFunctionCollapse is an algorithm that generates bitmaps that are locally similar to the input bitmap. This is a translation into Python, based on the original implementation in C#.
